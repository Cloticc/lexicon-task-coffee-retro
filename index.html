Here's the translation to English:

● The webpage should consist of three sections.
● Each section should have a heading, text, and a background image as per the sketch.
● Each section should fill the entire window.
● There should be a menu with links to the three sections of the webpage.
● The background image for each section should cover the entire visible part of the browser window.
● The webpage should use semantic HTML elements to the highest extent possible.
● The menu should be fixed and always visible at the top of the browser window.
● The webpage should closely resemble the sketch provided by the advertising agency. -->
